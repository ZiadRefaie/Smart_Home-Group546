## About

The **Smart Home Project** utilizes the ATMEGA32A microcontroller to create a system capable of automating home appliances and monitoring environmental conditions. The system integrates various modules for input, output, and communication to offer a comprehensive solution for smart home control.

## Features

- **Two Modes**: Admin mode and User mode, with secure login functionality.
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Using an LM35 temperature sensor.
- **Lighting Control**: Includes LEDs and a dimmer circuit.
- **Device Control**: Operates devices via relay, servo motor, and DC motor.
- **User Interface**: Controlled via 16x2 LCD and 4x4 Keypad.
- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Enables remote control of the system.
- **External EEPROM**: Stores admin credentials and configurations persistently.

## Tools and Components

  - 4x4 Keypad
  - Bluetooth Module
  - Dimmer Circuit
  - LEDs (x5)
  - Servo Motor
  - DC Motor
  - LM35 Temperature Sensor

## Installation

1. A detailed installation video and schematic diagram of the circuit will be provided.  
2. Assemble the hardware according to the schematic.  
3. Flash the firmware to the ATMEGA32A microcontroller using an SPI programmer.  
4. Power on the system and follow the usage instructions.  

## Usage

1. **Login**:  
   - The system requires a secure login via the **4x4 Keypad**.  
   - Admins use a password stored in the EEPROM memory to access additional privileges.  

2. **Modes**:  
   - **User Mode**:  
     - View room temperature using the LM35 sensor.  
     - Control the AC power.  
     - Toggle house lamps ON/OFF.  
     - Adjust lighting levels with the dimmer circuit.  
   - **Admin Mode**:  
     - Access all User Mode features.  
     - Additional privileges, such as controlling the door via the servo motor.  

3. **Bluetooth Control**:  
   - Once logged in, use the Bluetooth Module to remotely interact with components.
