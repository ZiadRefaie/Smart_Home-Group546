## About

The **Smart Home Project** utilizes the ATMEGA32A microcontroller to create a system capable of automating home appliances and monitoring environmental conditions. The system integrates various modules for input, output, and communication to offer a comprehensive solution for smart home control.

## Features

- **Two Modes**: Admin mode and User mode, with secure login functionality.
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Using an LM35 temperature sensor.
- **Lighting Control**: Includes LEDs and a dimmer circuit.
- **Device Control**: Operates devices via relay, servo motor, and DC motor.
- **User Interface**: Controlled via 16x2 LCD and 4x4 Keypad.
- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Enables remote control of the system.

   - The system requires a secure login via the **4x4 Keypad**.  
   - Admins access additional privileges compared to users.  

2. **Modes**:  
   - **User Mode**:  
     - View room temperature using the LM35 sensor.  
     - Control the AC power.  
     - Toggle house lamps ON/OFF.  
     - Adjust lighting levels with the dimmer circuit.  
   - **Admin Mode**:  
     - Access all User Mode features.  
     - Additional privileges, such as controlling the door via the servo motor.  

3. **Bluetooth Control**:  
   - Once logged in, use the Bluetooth Module to interact with components remotely.
